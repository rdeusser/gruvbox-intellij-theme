# Gruvbox Intellij IDEA Theme

![screenshot](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/files/12310/screenshot_19486.png)

gruvbox is heavily inspired by badwolf, jellybeans and solarized.

Designed as a bright theme with pastel 'retro groove' colors and light/dark mode switching in the way of solarized.
The main focus when developing gruvbox is to keep colors easily distinguishable, contrast enough and still pleasant for the eyes.
